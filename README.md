# Cube

!!! This code is written during a study phase, and while it serves the purpose of simulating cube rotations, there are opportunities for improvement in terms of efficiency and coding practices. 

The Cube class models a single cube with rotation operations, and the CubeManager class manages a collection of cubes, allowing rotations based on a specified key. The key is used to determine which cubes to rotate and in which direction. The overall idea is to simulate the manipulation of a group of cubes using rotation operations specified by a key.
